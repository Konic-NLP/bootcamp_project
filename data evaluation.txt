The dataset is a json file, which may not be a common file format for the researcher and the beginner in data science, which may hinder them to interpret the data and handle them with Python or R. However, It would look weird and hard to align for each event if we switch the data into a spreadsheet since the items for each event in this dataset are different(some events have the ‘pb_roleset’ value, but some do not). One possible solution to this might be to set some empty value if there exists no such item. But such a json format would be fits for the programming languages which support the json io and have built-in dictionary data structures as we can consider the json format as a kind of dictionary(more generally, is hash table), and the column name is the key, and the value in the specific row is the value for the dictionary key-value pair.

Some items names and values names are not quite intuitive, like ‘overlay_parents’,’constraints’, which confuse the user and not understand the meaning of those terms. Similarly, there exists a lot of acronyms in the data, like ‘wd’ stands for wikidata, ‘pb’ stands for propbank, ‘ppt’ stands for patient. However, these are not universal terms or acronyms. Moreover, the data have typos and inconsistencies issues, like for arguments name, ‘’A2_gol_destination" amd “”A2_gol__destination" exists in the same time, but the number of underscores are different,
As the data is updating from time to time and the project is still in progress, I would expect that creating an exhaustive explanation for the data, especially for the term and double-check before it is published to the public and used for academia.
