# bootcamp_project
This is a repository for CRDDS Research Data Bootcamp.
- ### Overview

In this project, we have several files:

| file_name         | description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| main.ipynb        | Python Jupyter notebook as the main script |
| template_info.csv | the output generated by our code|
|xpo_v5.3.json      | source data for our project       |
|dwd_templates for json.xlsx|  the pattern spreadsheet to help generate the template_info.csv|

Our project focuses on the semantic role labeling and template generation. Semantic Role labeling is a subtask in Natural Language processing, which describes the event and participants in the event, which we called 'arguments'.
Like 'Eat', we can consider as a event, and the major arguments are the one who does the 'eat' action(eater) and the thing that is eaten by the 'eater'.
A example for this event is :
> *Mary eats an apple* 

In this example, ***Mary*** is the eater, ***eat*** is the verb(we call it 'trigger', which trigger the 'eat' event), ***apple*** is the thing that is eaten. 


Based on such information, we can generate a template for this event, like 
<A0_eater> eat <A1_the_thing_is_eaten>.
A0 means the agent and A1 means the patient in linguistics.

**Generating the template is our main purpose**

While some arguments may co-occur with a preposition, like ***"cause/reason"***, it may co-occur with ***For***,

like:
> He robbed the millionaire for the money

We will consider ***the money*** is the ***cause/reason***. The file ***dwd templates for json***
offer the different prepositions with different arguments to help us generate the template.

*xpo_v5.3* is the main source data, which can be found in <https://github.com/e-spaulding/xpo>

The file is a json file, each events is identified by an id which starts with   'DWD',  is an id in wikidata called qnode,  there includes much information, but we mainly use the followings
1. **name**: the name for the event
2. **pb_roleset**: the name for the event in the propbank, can be found here: <https://propbank.github.io/>
3. arguments: all the arguments in the event, we mainly use the name and short_name to generate the templates for the events

*template_info.csv* is the output, which is a spreadsheet, it include 4 column: the qnode, event name, template, and the left arguments that not in the dwd_templates for json and cannot add into the template.
